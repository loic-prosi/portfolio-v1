# portfolio-v1

Developer portfolio displaying my various projects.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Features

### Home page
A the top, a navigation bar containing my firstname, lastname, logo and the links to the different pages (Works, About).  
In the center of the page a section can be found with the job title and a brief introduction phrase.  
Social network links can be found at the bottom (Github and LinkedIn).

### Works page
List of cards containing the name, year and the logo of the project. One or more tags are present corresponding to the categories of the project (front-end, back-end, SEO or project management).  
When a user click on one project he is redirected to the corresponding page.  
Also, projects can be filtered by categories.

### Work page
Contains the details of one project. The name, a description, an image, the year and the corresponding skills used to make the project.

### About page
My motivations as a web developper.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
